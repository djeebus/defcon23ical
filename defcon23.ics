DESCRIPTION:\n A Hacker’s Guide to Risk\n Bruce Potter The Shmoo Group\n
  \n When the latest and greatest vulnerability is announced\, the media an
 d PR frenzy can be dizzying. However\, when the dust settles\, how do we a
 ctually measure the risk represented by a given vulnerability. When pen te
 sters find holes in an organization\, is it really “ZOMG\, you’re SO 0
 WNED!” or is it something more manageable and controlled? When you’re 
 attempting to convince the boss of the necessity of the latest security te
 chnology\, how do really rank the importance of the technology against the
  threats facing the organization.\n \n Understanding risk can be tricky\, 
 especially in an industry that often works on gut feelings and values quan
 tity over quality. But risk and risk management doesn’t need to be compl
 icated. With a few basic formulas and access to some simple models\, under
 standing risk can be a straightforward process. This talk will discuss ris
 k\, why its important\, and the poor job the hacker community has done whe
 n it comes to properly assessing risk. It will also touch on some existing
  risk assessment and management systems\, as well as provide worked exampl
 es of real world vulnerabilities and systems and the risks they pose. Fina
 lly\, this talk will examine some practical guidance on how you\, as hacke
 rs\, security researchers\, and security practitioners can better measure 
 risk in your day to day life\n \n Bruce Potter is the founder of The Shmoo
  Group\, one of the organizers of ShmooCon\, and a director at KEYW Corpor
 ation. Bruce's lack of degrees and certifications hasn't stopped him from 
 discussing infosec in numerous articles\, books\, and presentations. Bruce
  has been in the computer security field for nearly 2 decades which means 
 he is getting old and increasingly jaded. His primary focus areas are trus
 ted computing\, cyber security risk management (yikes!)\, and large scale 
 vulnerability analysis. Bruce believes that while attackers have the upper
  hand\, we can still do better with the tools we have than most people rea
 lize. Bruce also believes in using fake names when ordering coffee but occ
 asionally uses his real name to throw people off his scent.\n \n Twitter:

DESCRIPTION:\n And That's How I Lost My Other Eye: Further Explorations In
  Data Destruction\n Zoz Robotics Engineer and Security Researcher\n \n How
  much more paranoid are you now than you were four years ago?  Warrantless
  surveillance and large-scale data confiscation have brought fear of the f
 eds filching your files from black helicopter territory into the mainstrea
 m.  Recent government snatch-and-grabs have run the gamut from remotely im
 aging foreign servers to straight up domestic coffeeshop muggings\, so if 
 you think you might need to discard a lot of data in hurry you're probably
  right.  In their legendary DEF CON 19 presentation Shane Lawson\, Bruce P
 otter and Deviant Ollam kicked off the discussion\, and now it's time for 
 another installment.  While purging incriminating material residing on spi
 nning disks remains the focus\, the research has been expanded to encompas
 s solid state storage and mobile solutions to your terabyte trashing needs
 .  With best efforts to comply with the original constraints\, the 2015 up
 date features more analysis of the efficacy of kinetic projectiles\, energ
 etic materials and high voltages for saving your freedom at the potential 
 cost of only a redundant body part... or two.\n \n Zoz is a robotics engin
 eer\, rapid prototyping specialist and lifelong enthusiast of the pyrotech
 nic arts.  Once he learned you could use a flamethrower and a coffee cream
 er bomb to fake a crop circle for TV he realized there are really no limit

DESCRIPTION:\n Are We Really Safe? - Bypassing Access Control Systems\n De
 nnis Maldonado Security Consultant - KLC Consulting \n \n \n Access contro
 l systems are everywhere. They are used to protect everything from residen
 tial communities to commercial offices. People depend on these to work pro
 perly\, but what if I had complete control over your access control soluti
 on just by using my phone? Or perhaps I input a secret keypad combination 
 that unlocks your front door? You may not be as secure as you think.\n \n 
 The world relies on access control systems to ensure that secured areas ar
 e only accessible to authorized users. Usually\, a keypad is the only thin
 g stopping an unauthorized person from accessing the private space behind 
 it. There are many types of access control systems from stand-alone keypad
 s to telephony access control. In this talk\, Dennis will be going over ho
 w and where access control systems are used. Dennis will walk through and 
 demonstrate the tips and tricks used in bypassing common access control sy
 stems. This presentation will include attack methods of all nature includi
 ng physical attacks\, RFID\, wireless\, telephony\, network\, and more. \n
  \n Dennis Maldonado is a Security Consultant at KLC Consulting. His curre
 nt work includes vulnerability management\, penetration testing\, infrastr

DESCRIPTION:\n Abusing XSLT for Practical Attacks\n Fernando Arnaboldi Sen
 ior Security Consultant at IOActive \n \n \n Over the years\, XML has been
  a rich target for attackers due to flaws in its design as well as impleme

 languages to interconnect applications and is supported by web browsers. I
 n this talk\, I will demonstrate how to use XSLT to produce documents that
  are vulnerable to new exploits.\n \n XSLT can be leveraged to affect the 
 integrity of arithmetic operations\, lead to code logic failure\, or cause
  random values to use the same initialization vector. Error disclosure has
  always provided valuable information\, but thanks to XSLT\, it is possibl
 e to partially read system files that could disclose service or system's p
 asswords. Finally\, XSLT can be used to compromise end-user confidentialit
 y by abusing the same-origin policy concept present in web browsers.\n \n 
 This presentation includes proof-of-concept attacks demonstrating XSLT’s
  potential to affect production systems\, along with recommendations for s
 afe development.\n \n Fernando Arnaboldi is a senior security researcher a

DESCRIPTION:\n Extending Fuzzing Grammars to Exploit Unexplored Code Paths
  in Modern Web Browsers\n Saif El-Sherei Analyst\, SensePost \n Etienne St
 almans Analyst\, SensePost \n \n Fuzzing is a well-established technique f
 or finding bugs\, hopefully exploitable ones\, by brute forcing inputs to 
 explore code paths in an application. In recent years\, fuzzing has become
  a near mandatory part of any major application's security team efforts. O
 ur work focused on fuzzing web browsers\, a particularly difficult challen
 ge given the size and quality of some of their security teams\, the existi
 ng high-quality fuzzers available for this\, and\, of late\, bug bounty pr
 ograms.\n \n Despite this\, our improved fuzzing approach was able to find
  four confirmed bugs within Google Chrome and two within Microsoft Interne
 t Explorer 11. The bugs had varying potential exploitability. Interestingl
 y\, some had been independently discovered indicating others are active in
  this field. The work is on going\, and we hope to have more before the pr
 esentation.\n \n As browsers continue to grow as the new universal interfa
 ce for devices and applications\, they have become high value targets for 
 exploitation. Additionally\, with the growth of browser fuzzing since 2004
 \, this is a complex field to get started in. Something we hope to help ad
 dress.\n \n Our research and presentation will consist of two parts: \n \n
  The first part is an introduction to fuzzing for the security practitione
 r. Here we combine the approaches\, tool sets and integrations between too
 ls we found to be most effective into a recipe for fuzzing various browser
 s and various platforms. \n \n The second part is a description of our wor
 k and approach used to create\, and extend\, browser fuzzing grammars base
 d on w3c specifications to discover new and unexplored code paths\, and fi
 nd new browser security bugs. In particular\, example of real bugs found i
 n the Chrome and IE browser will be demonstrated.\n \n \n Saif is the body
  double for Borat\, but couldn't pull off a mankini and ended up in inform
 ation security. His focus is on fuzzing and vulnerability research. \n \n 
 Etienne hopes he will outlive his beard\, but in the meantime\, this hacki
 ng schtick pays for beard oil. His other interests lie in mobile applicati
 ons and no-sql databases. Both are analysts within SensePost's London offi

 nvestigate the unique security challenges and issues facing the industry. 
 It was a shock to me at first how complex the advertising ecosystem was pa
 rticularly in the advent of programmatic advertising. But I dove in head f
 irst and learned a lot which I would like to share with my fellow security
  professionals. During this time\, I got involved with unscrupulous publis
 hers\, apathetic ad networks\, angry advertisers and activist malware rese
 archers. I encountered self proclaimed experts with fantastic claims\, ven
 dors using scare tactics\, and a glaring disconnect between the security a
 nd ad tech worlds.   \n \n In this presentation\, I would like to be able 
 to provide the audience with my experience plus a number of things. Among 
 which are:\n \n \n Provide security professionals a 101 type of introducti
 on to the world of digital advertising ecosystem. Among the things we will
  tackle is what is programmatic advertising\, what the roles are of the di
 fferent players like ad networks are and how money is made off all this in
 terplay. \n \n Provide the audience a perspective on what security challen
 ges the advertising industry is facing and opportunities for us security p
 rofessionals to be involved. We all know about malvertising and its a big 
 deal to us security guys but there are bigger\, and in an advertisers pers
 pective\, more relevant issues that needs to be taken care of first. All o
 f this will be discussed in this talk.   \n \n An introduction about the d
 ifferent and creative ways unscrupulous publishers can pad their earnings.
  We will be talking about hidden ads\, ad stacking\, intrusive ads\, auto-
 refreshes\, popups\, popunders\, blackhat SEO techniques and dirty invento
 ry. \n \n An in depth discussion on the problems caused by non-human traff
 ic (NHT). We will talk about what it is\, why is it a problem\, how it is 
 generated\, and more importantly\, how do we catch it?  In fact\, this pre
 sentation is named the “Bieber Project” which is the experiment which 
 I leveraged to understand non-human traffic and determine how we can ident

 s a remote management framework that enables the collection of host inform
 ation\, execution of code\, and provides an eventing system that can respo
 nd to operating system events in real time. FireEye has recently seen a su
 rge in attacker use of WMI to carry out objectives such as system reconnai
 ssance\, remote code execution\, persistence\, lateral movement\, covert d
 ata storage\, and VM detection. Defenders and forensic analysts have large
 ly remained unaware of the value of WMI due to its relative obscurity and 
 completely undocumented file format. After extensive reverse engineering\,
  our team has documented the WMI repository file format in detail\, develo
 ped libraries to parse it\, and formed a methodology for finding evil in t
 he repository.\n \n In this talk\, we will take a deep dive into the archi
 tecture of WMI\, reveal a case study in attacker use of WMI in the wild\, 
 describe WMI attack mitigation strategies\, show how to mine its repositor
 y for forensic artifacts\, and demonstrate how to detect attacker activity
  in real-time by tapping into the WMI eventing system. By the end of this 
 talk\, we will have convinced the audience that WMI is a valuable asset no

SUMMARY:High-Def Fuzzing: Exploring Vulnerabilities in HDMI-CEC

DESCRIPTION:\n High-Def Fuzzing: Exploring Vulnerabilities in HDMI-CEC\n J
 oshua Smith Senior Security Researcher\, HP Zero Day Initiative\n \n The H
 DMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) standard has gained extensive 
 market penetration.  Nearly every piece of modern home theater equipment 
 has HDMI support and most modern mobile devices actually have HDMI-capabl
 e outputs\, though it may not be obvious.  Lurking inside most modern HD
 MI-compatible devices is something called HDMI-CEC\, or Consumer Electron
 ics Control.  This is the functionality that allows a media device to\, 
 for example\, turn on your TV and change the TV’s input.  That doesn
 ’t sound interesting\, but as we'll see in this presentation\, there ar
 e some very surprising things an attacker can do by exploiting CEC softwa
 re implementations.  Then there's something called HEC or HDMI Ethernet 
 Connection\, which allows devices to establish an Ethernet connection of 
 up to 100Mbit/s over their HDMI connections (newer HDMI standards raise t
 he speed to 1Gbit/s).\n \n Don't think your mobile phone implements CEC? 
  You might be wrong.  Most modern Android-based phones and tablets have
  a Slimport(r) connection that supports\n HDMI-CEC.  Ever heard of MHL (M
 obile High-Definition Link)?  Think Samsung and HTC (among other) mobile
  devices\, and many JVC\, Kenwood\, Panasonic\, and Sony car stereos – 
 as many as 750 million devices in the world so far.  Guess what?  MHL s
 upports HDMI-CEC as well. Let's explore\, and own\, this attack space.\n \
 n Kernelsmith is senior vulnerability researcher with Hewlett-Packard Secu
 rity Research (HPSR).  In this role\, he analyzes and performs root-cause
  analysis on hundreds of vulnerabilities submitted to the Zero-Day Initia
 tive (ZDI) program\, which represents the world’s largest vendor-agnost
 ic bug bounty program. His focus includes analyzing and performing root-c
 ause analysis on hundreds of zero-day vulnerabilities submitted by ZDI re
 searchers from around the world. Joshua is also a developer for the Metasp
 loit Framework and has spoken at a few conferences and holds a few certif
 ications.\n \n Prior to joining HP\, Smith served in the U.S. Air Force in
  various roles including as an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) C
 rew Commander and Instructor\, but more relevantly as a penetration teste
 r for the 92d Information Warfare Aggressor Squadron. Post-military\, he 
 became a security engineer at the John Hopkins University Applied Physics
  Lab\, where he began contributing to the Metasploit Framework. Smith per
 formed research into weapons systems vulnerabilities as well as evasion a
 nd obfuscation techniques to add depth and realism to security device tes
 ts. Smith received a B.S. in Aeronautical Engineering from Rensselaer Pol
 ytechnic Institute and an M.A. in Management of Information Systems from 
 the University of Great Falls.\n \n Smith was drawn to ZDI for the chance 
 to work with a world-wide network of security researchers while continuing
  his own vulnerability research.  When not researching software vulnerab
 ilities\, Josh enjoys raising his two young hackers-to-be and watching sci

DESCRIPTION:\n \n From 0 To Secure In 1 Minute — Securing IAAS\n Nir Val
 tman CISO – Retail\, NCR \n Moshe Ferber Co-chairman of the board\, Clou
 d Security Alliance Israel \n \n Recent hacks to IaaS platforms reveled th
 at we need to master the attack vectors used: Automation and API attack ve
 ctor\, insecure instances and management dashboard with wide capabilities.
  Those attack vectors are not unique to Cloud Computing but there are magn
 ified due to the cloud characteristics. The fact is that IaaS instance lif
 ecycle is accelerating\, nowadays we can find servers that are installed\,
  launched\, process data and terminate - all within a range of minutes. Th
 is new accelerated lifecycle makes traditional security processes such as 
 periodic patches\, vulnerability scanning\, hardening\, and forensics impo
 ssible. In this accelerated lifecycle\, there are no maintenance windows f
 or patches or ability to mitigate vulnerability\, so the security infrastr
 ucture must adapt to new methods. In this new thinking\, we require automa
 tion of instance security configuration\, hardening\, monitoring\, and ter
 mination. Because there are no maintenance windows\, Servers must be patch
 ed before they boot up\, security configuration and hardening procedures s
 hould be integrated with server installation and vulnerability scanning an
 d mitigation processes should be automatic.\n \n In the presentation\, we 
 plan to announce the full version of a new open source tool called "Cloude
 figo" and explain how it enables accelerated security lifecycle. We demons
 trate how to launch a pre-configured\, already patched instance into an en
 crypted storage environment automatically while evaluating their security 
 and mitigating them automatically if a vulnerability is found. In the live
  demo\, we leverage Amazon Web Services EC2 Cloud-Init scripts and object 
 storage for provisioning automated security configuration\, integrating en
 cryption\, including secure encryption key repositories for secure server'
 s communication. The result of those techniques is cloud servers that are 
 resilient\, automatically configured\, with the reduced attack surface.\n

DESCRIPTION:\n Hacking the Human Body/brain: Identity Shift\, the Shape of
  a New Self\, and Humanity 2.0\n Richard Thieme Author and Professional Sp
 eaker\, ThiemeWorks\n \n This presentation is beyond fiction.\n \n Current
  research in neuroscience and the extension and augmentation of senses is 
 proceeding in directions that might sound to a twentieth century mind like
  science fiction. Progress is rapid but unevenly distributed: Some is dire
 cted by military\, intelligence and corporate interests but beyond their c
 oncerns\, we can discern the future shape of human identity itself in nasc
 ent forms.\n \n The human body/brain is being hacked to explore radical ap
 plications for helping\, healing\, and harming this and future generations
 . Some can be done in garage-hacking style. The presenter\, in fact\, rece
 ntly had lenses in both eyes removed and replaced with artificial ones eng
 ineered for the vision he wanted\, a now-trivial surgery. The reach of new
  technologies promises an even more radical transformation in what it mean
 s to be human.\n \n One area of research is the recovery of memories\, the
  deletion of emotional charges from memories\, the removal of specific mem
 ories\, the alteration of the content of memories\, and the implantation o
 f new memories. Another seeks to read the mind at a distance and extract i
 nformation. Another explores the use of genomes to understand and replicat
 e thinking\, feeling\, and behavior patterns. Another implements mind-to-m
 ind communication\, using neuroscience to understand brains best suited fo
 r remote viewing as well as implants and non-invasive technologies that co
 ntrol the electromagnetic energies of the brain to enable psychokinesis\, 
 clairvoyance and telepathy.\n \n Augmentation of human abilities is being 
 achieved by splicing information from sensors integrated with existing neu
 rological channels. To feel the magnetic field of the earth\, see the infr
 ared and ultraviolet parts of the electromagnetic spectrum\, discern the y
 aw and pitch of airplanes\, see and hear by going around our eyes and ears
  -- all this means we will experience the “self” in new ways.\n \n Thi
 eme concludes with quotes from remote viewer Joe McMoneagle\, astronaut Ed
 gar Mitchell\, and his new novel FOAM to suggest the shape of the mind of 
 the future. If you're 20 years old\, you have at least a century of produc
 tive life ahead of you\, so you had better be on board with the shape of y
 our future selves. :-)\n \n Richard Thieme is an author and professional s
 peaker focused on the challenges posed by new technologies and the future\
 , how to redesign ourselves to meet these challenges\, and creativity in r
 esponse to radical change and identify shift. He has explored issues raise
 d in this DEF CON 23 presentation for 20 years but raises his game to outl
 ine the shape of the future self\, defining it as a system open to modific
 ation and hacking\, giving the term “biohacking” new and compelling me
 aning.\n \n His column\, "Islands in the Clickstream\," was distributed to
  subscribers in sixty countries before collection as a book in 2004. When 
 a friend at the NSA said after they worked together on intelligence issues
 \, "The only way you can tell the truth is through fiction\," he returned 
 to writing short stories\, 19 of which are collected in “Mind Games.” 
 He is co-author of the critically extolled “UFOs and Government: A Histo
 rical Inquiry\,” a 5-year research project using material exclusively fr
 om government documents and other primary sources\, now in 50 university l
 ibraries. A recently completed novel FOAM explores the existential challen
 ges of what it means to be human in the 21st century. “The UFO History G
 roup” is exploring a second volume and Thieme is selecting “the best o
 f” his diverse writings for “A Richard Thieme Reader” and writing mo
 re fiction.\n \n Thieme's work has been taught at universities in Europe\,
  Australia\, Canada\, and the United States\, and he has guest lectured at
  numerous universities\, including Purdue University (CERIAS)\, the Techno

 ived attention that would make a rockstar jealous. Discussion of malware h
 as shifted in focus from ‘cyber crime’  to ‘cyber weapons’\, there
  have been intense public debates on attribution of various high profile a
 ttacks\, and heated policy discussion surrounding regulation of offensive 
 tools. We’ve also seen the sale of ‘lawful intercept’ malware become
  a global trade. \n \n While a substantial focus has revolved around the a
 ctivities of China\, Russia\, and Iran\, recent discoveries have revealed 
 the capabilities of Western nations such as WARRIORPRIDE aka. Regin (FVEY)
  and SNOWGLOBE aka. Babar (France). Many have argued that digital operatio
 ns are a logical\, even desirable part of modern statecraft. The step from
  digital espionage to political persecution is\, however\, a small one. Co
 mmercially written\, offensive software from companies like FinFisher and 
 Hacking Team has been sold to repressive regimes under the guise of ‘gov
 ernmental intrusion’ software. \n \n Nation state hacking operations are
  frequently well-funded\, difficult to attribute\, and rarely prosecuted e
 ven if substantive evidence can be discovered. While efforts have been mad
 e to counter this problem\, proof is hard to find and even more difficult 
 to correctly interpret. This creates a perfect storm of conditions for lie
 s\, vendor lies\, and flimsy attribution.\n \n In this talk we will unveil
  the mess happening backstage when uncovering nation state malware\, lead 
 the audience on the track of actor attribution\, and cover what happens wh
 en you find other players on the hunt. We will present a novel approach to
  binary stylometry\, which helps matching binaries of equal authorship and
  allows credible linking of binaries into the bigger picture of an attack.

DESCRIPTION:\n Angry Hacking - the next generation of binary analysis\n Ya
 n Shoshitaishvili PhD Student\, UC Santa Barbara\n Fish Wang PhD Student\,
  UC Santa Barbara\n \n Security has gone from a curiosity to a phenomenon 
 in the last decade. Fortunately for us\, despite the rise of memory-safe\,
  interpreted\, lame languages\, the security of binaries is as relevant as
  ever. On top of that\, (computer security) Capture the Flag competitions 
 have skyrocketed in popularity\, with new and exciting binaries on offer f
 or hacking every weekend.\n \n This all sounds great\, and it is. Unfortun
 ately\, the more time goes by\, the older we get\, and the more our skills
  fade. Whereas we were happy to stare at objdump a decade ago\, today\, we
  find the menial parts of reversing and pwning more and more tiring and mo
 re and more difficult. Worse\, while security analysis tools have been evo
 lving to make life easier for us hackers\, the core tools that we use (lik
 e IDA Pro) have remained mostly stagnant. And on top of that\, the term "b
 inaries" have expanded to regularly include ARM\, MIPS\, PPC\, MSP430\, an
 d every other crazy architecture you can think of\, rather than the nice\,
  comfortable x86 of yesteryear.\n \n New tools are required\, and we're he
 re to deliver. Over the last two years\, we have been working on a next-ge
 neration binary analysis framework in an attempt to turn back the tide and
  reduce our mounting noobness. The result is called angr.\n \n angr assist
 s in binary analysis by providing extremely powerful\, state-of-the-art an
 alyses\, and making them as straightforward to use as possible. Ever wante
 d to know *what freaking value* some variable could take on in a function 
 (say\, can the target of a computed write point to the return address)? an
 gr can tell you! Want to know what input you need to trigger a certain cod
 e path and export a flag? Ask angr! In the talk\, we'll cover three of the
  analyses that angr provides: a powerful static analysis engine (able to\,
  among other things\, automatically identify potential memory corruption i
 n binaries through the use of Value-Set Analysis)\, its symbolic execution
  engine\, and dynamic emulation of various architectures (*super* useful f
 or debugging shellcode).\n \n On top of that\, angr is designed to make th
 e life of a hacker as easy as possible -- for example\, the whole system i
 s 98% Python\, and is designed to be a breeze to interact with through iPy
 thon. Plus\, it comes with a nifty GUI with nice visualizations for symbol
 ically exploring a program\, tracking differences between different progra
 m paths\, and understanding value ranges of variables and registers. Final
 ly\, angr is designed to be easily extensible and embeddable in other appl
 ications. We'll show off a semantic-aware ROP gadget finder ("are there an
 y gadgets that write to a positive offset of rax but don't clobber rbx" or
  "given this program state\, what are the gadgets that won't cause a segfa
 ult") and a binary diffing engine\, both built on angr.\n \n We've used an
 gr to solve CTF binaries\, analyze embedded devices\, debug shellcode\, an
 d even dabble in the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge. We'll talk about our exp
 eriences with all of that and will release angr to the world\, hopefully r
 evolutionizing binary analysis and making everyone ANGRY!\n \n \n Yan and 
 Fish are two members of Shellphish\, a pretty badass hacking team famous f
 or low SLA and getting the freaking exploit JUST A FREAKING MINUTE LATE. T
 heir secret identities are those of PhD students in the security lab of UC
  Santa Barbara. When they're not CTFing or surfing\, they're doing next-ge
 neration (what does that even mean?) security research. Their works have b
 een published in numerous academic venues. For example\, in 2013\, they cr
 eated an automatic tool\, called MovieStealer\, a tool to automatically br
 eak the DRM of streaming media services [1]. After taking 2014 to work on 
 angr\, in 2015\, they followed this up with an analysis of backdoors in em
 bedded devices [2].\n \n \n Now\, they've set their sights on helping the 
 world analyze binaries faster\, better\, stronger\, by revolutionizing the
  analysis tool landscape!\n \n \n [1] https://www.usenix.org/conference/us

DESCRIPTION:\n Security Necromancy: Further Adventures in Mainframe Hackin
 g\n Philip Young aka Soldier of Fortran\, Chief Mainframe Hacker\n Chad "B
 igendian Smalls” Rikansrud President of Mainframe Hacking\n \n You thoug
 ht they were dead didn't you? You thought "I haven't seen a mainframe sinc
 e the 90s\, no one uses those anymore." Well you're wrong. Dead wrong. If 
 you flew or drove to DEF CON your information was hitting a mainframe. Did
  you use credit or cash at the hotel? Doesn't matter\, still a mainframe. 
 Did you pay taxes\, or perhaps call 911? What about going to the doctor? A
 ll using mainframes. At multiple points throughout the day\, even if you d
 on't do anything\, your data is going through some mainframe\, somewhere. 
 1984? Yeah right\, man. That's a typo. Orwell is here now. He's livin' lar
 ge. So why is no one talking about them?\n \n \n SoF & Bigendian Smalls\, 
 aka 'the insane chown posse'\, will dazzle and amaze with feats of hackery
  never before seen on the mainframe. From fully breaking network job entry
  (NJE) and their concept of trusted nodes\, to showing you what happens wh
 en you design security in the 80s and never update your frameworks. We'll 
 demonstrate that\, yes Charlie Brown\, you can in fact overflow a buffer o
 n the mainframe. New tools will be released! Things like SET'n'3270 (SET\,
  but for mainframes!) and VTAM walker (profiling VTAM applications). Updat
 es to current tools will be released (nmap script galore!) everything from
  accurate version profiling to application ID brute forcing and beyond. Yo
 u'll also learn how to navigate IBM so you can get access to your very own
  mainframe and help continue the research that we've started!\n \n \n All 
 of your paychecks rely on mainframes in one form or another\, so maybe we 
 should be talking about it.\n \n Soldier of Fortran:\n Protect ya REXX! So
 ldier of Fortran has an unhealthy relationship with mainframes. Being a ha
 cker from way back in the day (BBS and X.25 networks) he was always enamor
 ed by the idea of hacking mainframes. Always too expensive and mysterious 
 he settled on hacking windows and linux machines. However\, despite not ha
 ving his own he conducted numerous security engagements against mainframes
 \, slowly developing his skills\, until 2010 when he finally got his very 
 own. Not having to worry about system uptime or affecting users he dove in
  head first and was surprised by what he found. Ever since he has been tel
 ling anyone who will listen to him the importance of mainframe security\, 
 hacking and research. He’s spoken both domestically and internationallyo
 n the topic\, been a guest speaker at multiple conferences\, developed too
 ls for mainframe penetration testing and has even keynoted at large mainfr
 ame conferences about this topic.\n \n \n Bigendian Smalls:\n BS ain't no 
 chump\, takin' apart everything as a child just to see how it works invari
 able led him to security. From BBSin' back in the day to placing second in
  the network forensics challenge last year he knows what he's doing. At wo
 rk and at home he does vulnerability research\, forensics and disassembly 
 of all things both on hardware and software. Knowing no system is secure a
 nd seeing how closed the source\, community and information around the mai
 nframe is he got worried. Worried that the code was as secure as they said
  it was. Worried that because no one is looking\, developers are getting a
 way with murder. Sure\, IBM says they got their shit together\, but then a
 gain so does Oracle\, CISCO\, Fireeye etc . Having worked on mainframes fo
 r more than a decade he knows how frustrating this is. With books from the
  80s and forum posts from the 90s being of very little value\, he aims to 
 help drive the future of mainframe security research.\n Return to Top

 ork Streams\n   Eric Van Albert independent security researcher\n   Zach B
 anks independent security researcher\n   \n   \n   This project consists o
 f the hardware and software necessary to hijack wired network communicatio
 ns. The hardware allows an attacker to splice into live network cabling wi
 thout ever breaking the physical connection. This allows the traffic on th
 e line to be passively tapped and examined. Once the attacker has gained e
 nough knowledge about the data being sent\, the device switches to an acti
 ve tap topology\, where data in both directions can be modified on the fly
 . Through our custom implementation of the network stack\, we can accurate
 ly mimic the two devices across almost all OSI layers.\n   \n   We have de
 veloped several applications for this technology. Most notable is the edit
 ing of live video streams to produce a “camera loop\,” that is\, hijac
 king the feed from an Ethernet surveillance camera so that the same footag
 e repeats over and over again. More advanced video transformations can be 
 applied if necessary. This attack can be executed and activated with pract
 ically no interruption in service\, and when deactivated\, is completely t
 ransparent.\n   \n   Eric is a recent MIT graduate who spends his days bui
 lding 3D printers for Formlabs and his nights crawling around places he pr
 obably shouldn’t. He has taught seminars on lockpicking and physical sec

 mall bit of security consulting work. When he runs out of projects to hack
  on\, he reads the leaked NSA ANT catalog for ideas.\n   \n   Zach is also

 s talk will introduce you to Industrial Ethernet Switches and their vulner
 abilities. These are switches used in industrial environments\, like subst
 ations\, factories\, refineries\, ports\, or other  homes of industrial au
 tomation. In other words: DCS\, PCS\, ICS & SCADA switches.\n   \n   The r
 esearchers focus on attacking the management plane of these switches\, bec
 ause we all know that industrial system protocols lack authentication or c
 ryptographic integrity. Thus\, compromising any switch allows the creation
  of malicious firmwares for further MITM manipulation of a live process.  
 Such MITM manipulation can lead to the plant or process shutting down (thi
 nk: nuclear reactor SCRAM) or getting into a unknown and hazardous state (
 think: damaging a blast furnace at a steel mill)\n   \n   Not only will vu
 lnerabilities be disclosed for the first time\, but the methods of finding
  those vulnerabilities will be shared. All vulnerabilities disclosed will 
 be in the default configuration state of the devices. While these vulnerab
 ilities have been responsibly disclosed to the vendors\, SCADA/ICS patchin
 g in live environments tends to take 1-3 years.  Because of this patching 
 lag\, the researchers will also be providing live mitigations that owner/o
 perators can use immediately to protect themselves. At least four vendors 
 switches will be examined: Siemens\, GE\, Garrettcom and Opengear.\n   \n

DESCRIPTION:\n \n Exploring Layer 2 Network Security in Virtualized Enviro
 nments\n Ronny L. Bull Ph.D. Graduate Student\, Clarkson University\n Jean
 na N. Matthews Associate Professor\, Clarkson University\n \n Cloud servic
 e providers offer their customers the ability to deploy virtual machines i
 n a multi-tenant environment. These virtual machines are typically connect
 ed to the physical network via a virtualized network configuration. This c
 ould be as simple as a bridged interface to each virtual machine or as com
 plicated as a virtual switch providing more robust networking features suc
 h as VLANs\, QoS\, and monitoring. In this paper\, we explore whether Laye
 r 2 network attacks that work on physical switches apply to their virtuali
 zed counterparts by performing a systematic study across four major hyperv
 isor environments - Open vSwitch\, Citrix XenServer\, Microsoft Hyper-V Se
 rver and VMware vSphere - in seven different virtual networking configurat
 ions. First\, we use a malicious virtual machine to run a MAC flooding att
 ack and evaluate the impact on co-resident VMs. We find that network perfo
 rmance is degraded on all platforms and that it is possible to eavesdrop o
 n other client traffic passing over the same virtual network for Open vSwi
 tch and Citrix XenServer. Second\, we use a malicious virtual machine to r
 un a rogue DHCP server and then run multiple DHCP attack scenarios. On all
  four platforms\, co-resident VMs can be manipulated by providing them wit
 h incorrect or malicious network information.\n \n Mr. Bull is a Computer 
 Science Ph.D. graduate student at Clarkson University focusing on Layer 2 
 network security in virtualized environments. He presented his preliminary
  research involving MAC flooding attacks against virtualized networks at t
 he DerbyCon 4.0 computer security conference held in Louisville\, KY in Se
 ptember 2014. Mr. Bull earned an A.A.S. degree in Computer Networking at H
 erkimer College in 2006 and completed both a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Sci

DESCRIPTION:\n   Staying Persistent in Software Defined Networks\n   Grego
 ry Pickett Cybersecurity Operations\, Hellfire Security\n   \n   \n   The 
 Open Network Install Environment\, or ONIE\, makes commodity or WhiteBox E
 thernet possible. By placing a common\, Linux-based\, install environment 
 onto the firmware of the switch\, customers can deploy the Network Operati
 ng Systems of their choice onto the switch and do so whenever they like wi
 thout replacing the hardware. The problem is\, if this gets compromised\, 
 it also makes it possible for hackers to install malware onto the switch. 
 Malware that can manipulate it and your network\, and keep doing it long a
 fter a Network Operating System reinstall.\n   \n   With no secure boot\, 
 no encryption\, no authentication\, predictable HTTP/TFTP waterfalls\, and
  exposed post-installation partition\, ONIE is very susceptible to comprom
 ise. And with Network Operating Systems such as Switch Light\, Cumulus Lin
 ux\, and Mellanox-OS via their agents Indigo and eSwitchd not exactly putt
 ing up a fight with problems like no authentication\, no encryption\, poor
  encryption\, and insufficient isolation\, this is a real possibility.\n  
  \n   In this session\, we'll cover the weaknesses in ONIE\, ways to reach
  the platform through these Network Operating Systems\, and what can happe
 n if we don't properly protect the Control Plane these switches run on. I'
 ll even demonstrate with a drive-by web-attack that is able to pivot throu
 gh a Windows management station to reach the isolated control plane networ
 k\, and infect one of these ONIE-based switches with malware\, malware tha
 t's there even after a refresh. You'll even get the source code to take ho
 me with you to see how easily it's done. Finally\, we'll talk about how to
  compensate for these issues so that your network doesn't become infected 
 with and manipulated by this sort of persistent firmware-level malware.\n 
   \n   Gregory Pickett CISSP\, GCIA\, GPEN has a background in intrusion a
 nalysis for Fortune 100 companies but now heads up Hellfire Security’s M
 anaged Security Services efforts and participates in their assessment prac

DESCRIPTION:\n   Shall We Play a Game?\n   Tamas Szakaly Lead security res
 earcher @ PR-Audit Ltd.\, Hungary\n   \n   Everybody plays games\, and a w
 hole lot of people plays computer games. Despite this fact\, very few of u
 s\, security researchers consider them as interesting targets. Granted\, y
 ou won't likely be able to directly hack into a big corporate network via 
 game exploits\, but you could for example target the people running the co
 mpany via their favorite games. Or their children's favorite games. Anothe
 r scenario: you should consider that a hacked game could allow Not So Admi
 rable people access to your internal network - which at first does not see
 m that big of a deal considering it's "just" a home network\, but when you
  realize all your mobile phones\, your TV set\, your VOIP phones\, your se
 curity cameras\, and even your smart house sensors and controllers are par
 t of that network\, it looks much more scary.\n   \n   Games are also inte
 resting from a technical standpoint too\, since they tend to be quite comp
 lex. The majority of them have networking\, and they process complex data 
 structures (maps\, saved games\, etc.) which makes them ideal fuzzing targ
 ets. But this talk is not about those kind of exploits. Hackers tend to ig
 nore the low hanging fruits in favor of beautiful exploits\, but we really
  shouldn't - bad guys don't care about how sophisticated some exploit is\,
  they only care about the results. This is why I have decided to take a lo
 ok around and see what's already there in the games that allows access to 
 the gamers' network. Thus this research about how game scripting engines c
 an be abused started.\n   \n   I'll show in this talk that playing on cust
 om game servers and playing community created maps could easily lead to co
 de execution on our machines - more so\, in most cases without the need to
  bypass the operating system's exploit mitigation techniques. My targets i
 nclude popular games and game engines like CryEngine 3\, Dota 2\, Garry's 
 Mod\, ARMA3 and Digital Combat Simulator. I'll show a wide range of script
  abuse from a simple direct command execution in an unrestricted scripting
  environment through brute forcing a security camera via HTTP requests to 
 complex script sandbox escapes.\n   \n   Tamas is the lead IT security res
 earcher at PR-Audit Ltd.\, a company focusing mainly on penetration testin
 g and SIEM software developing. Previously he participated in a cooperatio
 n between ELTE Department of Meteorology and the Paks Nuclear Power Plant 
 Ltd. which goal was to develop TREX\, a toxic waste emission simulator usi
 ng CUDA. The scene from RoboCop where the kid defeats the evil robot with 
 just a laptop and a serial cable made a huge impression on him\, and after
  seeing the movie\, his path was set: he was bound to be a hacker. His fir
 st experiences in this field involved poking around various copy protectio
 n schemes\, and for this day his favorite areas of expertise are the ones 
 that require some mangling of binary files. Besides computer security he a

  primarily built on the tens of gigabytes of source code from the Android 
 Open Source Project (AOSP). Thoroughly reviewing a code base of this size 
 is arduous at best -- arguably impossible. Several approaches exist to com
 bat this problem. One such approach is identifying and focusing on a parti
 cularly dangerous area of code.\n   \n   This presentation centers around 
 the speaker's experience researching a particularly scary area of Android\
 , the Stagefright multimedia framework. By limiting his focus to a relativ
 ely small area of code that's critically exposed on 95% of devices\, Joshu
 a discovered a multitude of implementation issues with impacts ranging fro
 m unassisted remote code execution down to simple denial of service. Apart
  from a full explanation of these vulnerabilities\, this presentation also
  discusses\; techniques used for discovery\, Android OS internals\, and th

 .\n   \n   After attending this presentation\, you will understand how to 
 discover vulnerabilities in Android more effectively. Joshua will show you

    \n   Microeconomics focuses on how patterns of supply and demand determ
 ine price and output in individual markets [1]. Within recent years\, micr
 o-economies have flourished within the video game industry. Companies like
  Valve rely heavily on a business model that depends on gamers making purc
 hases for in-game items. Players can trade these items in bulk for a rare 
 item\, make bets on a competitive gaming match or gift the item for a char
 ity event.\n   \n   While originally well-intentioned\, creating these mic
 ro-economies also created an incentive for criminals to scam and even stea
 l from unsuspecting victims. Traditional scams date as far back to games l
 ike Diablo or Runescape where players were duped in trade windows and in g
 ame messaging systems were used to steal items. These low-tech strategies 
 are effective\, but recently a new\, high-tech scam strategy has emerged r
 elying upon malware specifically targeting the Steam micro-economy.\n   \n
    Over the last year\, we have collected and reversed dozens of samples o
 f malware that target Steam users. Pieces of malware can be sophisticated 
 RAM scrapers that pilfer an item in memory and send trade requests through
  the  Steam trading API\, or as simple as a remote login service. The end 
 result is the same - the hacker loots the victim’s backpack of in game i
 tems to sell them on the market for profit. This talk focuses on the techn
 iques we have found in these samples\, surveys of victims of these scams a
 nd the distribution of money lost from them (up to the $1000s of dollars f
 or users in some cases) and the defenses Steam has put in place to combat 
 this hacker underground.\n   \n   Zack Allen is an RIT graduate\, majoring

 ividuals. Almost all the security measures against keyloggers are post-act
 ive and static.\n \n *So what if the solution were to be proactive\, and u
 se the same technology as keyloggers do\, in order to fool them ? This is 
 all about this presentation\, a way of fooling all known and unknown keylo
 ggers (physicals\, kernel-mode and user-mode) through a kernel mode driver
  developed under Windows. The technical details will be presented during t
 he presentation\, as well as the results and propositions.\n \n Basically\
 , the idea is to use a kernel mode driver which encrypts each keyboard key
  hit\, at a very low level in the system (near the driver port). The encry
 ption is made according to a common key\, exchanged with a client applicat
 ion which needs to ensure that the entered text is secured and not recorde
 d. After the driver has encrypted a key\, it spreads it to the entire syst
 em. Thus\, only the client application\, holding the encryption key\, can 
 decrypt the keyboard key. In this way\, the whole system is fooled.\n \n P

 ity Researcher\, Tripwire VERT\n \n With insecure low frequency RFID acces
 s control badges still in use at businesses around the world and high freq
 uency NFC technology being incorporated into far more consumer products\, 
 RFID hacking tools are invaluable for penetration testers and security res
 earchers alike.  Software defined radio has revolutionized this field with
  powerful devices like Proxmark3 and RFIDler available for a modest price.
   3D printing has also presented new opportunities for makers to create cu
 stom antennas and cases to fit specific tasks.  While there is a lot of gr
 eat information out there about how people use these tools\, there is rela
 tively little more than source code available for learning how to develop 
 new firmware to equip these devices with purpose-built logic.  This presen
 tation will discuss the overall architecture of the Proxmark3 and RFIDler 
 tools and provide tutorial style examples for enhancing the firmware.  Pro
 xmark3 development will be demonstrated by upgrading the stand-alone mode 
 to support NFC operations.  For the new kid on the block\, RFIDler\, we wi
 ll take a look at how to tweak the system for optimal reliability using 3D
  printing and enhanced diagnostic tools.\n \n \n Craig Young (@CraigTweets

DESCRIPTION:\n Crypto for Hackers\n Eijah Founder\, Demonsaw\n \n Hacking 
 is hard.  It takes passion\, dedication\, and an unwavering attention to d
 etail.  Hacking requires a breadth of knowledge spread across many domains
 .  We need to have experience with different platforms\, operating systems
 \, software packages\, tools\, programming languages\, and technology tren
 ds.  Being overly deficient in any one of these areas can add hours to our
  hack\, or even worse\, bring us total failure.\n \n And while all of thes
 e things are important for a well-rounded hacker\, one of the key areas th
 at is often overlooked is cryptography.  In an era dominated by security b
 reaches\, an understanding of encryption and hashing algorithms provides a
  tremendous advantage.  We can better hone our attack vectors\, especially
  when looking for security holes.  A few years ago I released the first Bl
 u-Ray device key\, AA856A1BA814AB99FFDEBA6AEFBE1C04\, by exploiting a vuln
 erability in an implementation of the AACS protocol.  As hacks go\, it was
  a simple one.  But it was the knowledge of crypto that made it all possib
 le.\n \n This presentation is an overview of the most common crypto routin
 es helpful to hackers.  We'll review the strengths and weaknesses of each 
 algorithm\, which ones to embrace\, and which ones to avoid.  You'll get C
 ++ code examples\, high-level wrapper classes\, and an open-source library
  that implements all the algorithms.  We'll even talk about creative ways 
 to merge algorithms to further increase entropy and key strength.  If you'
 ve ever wanted to learn how crypto can give you an advantage as a hacker\,
  then this talk is for you.  With this information you'll be able to maxim
 ize your hacks and better protect your personal data.\n \n Eijah is the fo

DESCRIPTION:\n   Detecting Randomly Generated Strings\; A Language Based A
 pproach\n   Mahdi Namazifar Senior Data Scientist\, Talos Team\, Cisco Sys
 tems\n   \n   \n   Numerous botnets employ domain generation algorithms (D
 GA) to dynamically generate a large number of random domain names from whi
 ch a small subset is selected for their command and control. A vast majori
 ty of DGA algorithms create random sequences of characters. In this work w
 e present a novel language-based technique for detecting strings that are 
 generate by chaining random characters. To evaluate randomness of a given 
 string (domain name in this context) we lookup substrings of the string in
  the dictionary that we’ve built for this technique\, and then we calcul
 ate a randomness score for the string based on several different factors i
 ncluding length of the string\, number of languages that cover the substri
 ngs\, etc. This score is used for determining whether the given string is 
 a random sequence of characters. In order to evaluate the performance of t
 his technique\, on the one hand we use 9 known DGA algorithms to create ra
 ndom domain names as DGA domains\, and on the other hand we use domain nam
 es from the Alexa 10\,000 as likely non-DGA domains. The results show that
  our technique is more than 99% accurate in detecting random and non-rando
 m domain names.\n   \n   Mahdi Namazifar is currently a Senior Data Scient

 r \n \n Automating packer and compiler/toolchain detection can be tricky a
 nd best and downright frustrating at worst. The majority of existing solut
 ions are old\, closed source or aren’t cross platform. Originally\, a me
 thod of packer identification that leveraged some text analysis algorithms
  was presented. The goal is to create a method to identify compilers and p
 ackers based on the structural changes they leave behind in PE files. This
  iteration builds upon previous work of using assembly mnemonics for packe

 fication and clustering of PE files.\n \n Mike Sconzo has been around the 
 Security Industry for quite some time\, and is interested in creating and 
 implementing new methods of detecting unknown and suspicious network activ

 tition and Extortion\n   Marina Krotofil Senior Security Consultant. Europ
 ean Network for Cyber Security\n   Jason Larsen Principal Security Consult
 ant\, IOActive\n   \n   The appeal of hacking a physical process is dreami
 ng about physical damage attacks lighting up the sky in a shower of goodne
 ss.  Let’s face it\, after such elite hacking action nobody is going to 
 let one present it even at a conference like DEF CON. As a poor substitute
 \, this presentation will get as close as using a simulated plant for Viny
 l Acetate production for demonstrating a complete attack\, from start to e
 nd\, directed at persistent economic damage to a production site while avo
 iding attribution of production loss to a cyber-event. Such an attack scen
 ario could be useful to a manufacturer aiming at putting competitors out o
 f business or as a strong argument in an extortion attack.\n   \n   Pickin
 g up a paper these days it’s easy to find an article on all the “SCADA
  insecurity” out there associated with an unstoppable attacker with unso
 phisticated goal of kicking up another apocalypse. Sorry to disappoint exc
 ited crowd but formula “Your wish is my command” does not work for con
 trol systems.  The target plant is not designed in a hacker friendly way. 
 Hopefully by the end of the presentation\, the audience will understand th
 e difference between breaking into the system and breaking the system\, ob
 taining control and being in control.  An attacker targeting a remote proc
 ess is not immediately gifted with complete knowledge of the process and t
 he means to manipulate it. In general\, an attacker follows a series of st
 ages before getting to the final attack. Designing an attack scenario is a
  matter of art as much as economic consideration. The cost of attack can q
 uickly exceed damage worth. Also\, the attacker has to find the way to com
 pare between competing attack scenarios.\n   \n   In traditional IT hackin
 g\, a goal is to go undetected. In OT (operational technologies) hacking t
 his is not an option. An attack will change things in the real world that 
 cannot be removed by simply erasing the log files. If a piece of equipment
  is damaged or if a plant suddenly becomes less profitable\, it will be in
 vestigated. The attacker has to create forensic footprint for investigator
 s by manipulating the process and the logs in such a way that the analysts
  draw the wrong conclusions.\n   \n   Exploiting physical process is an ex
 otic and hard to develop skill which have so far kept a high barrier to en
 try. Therefore real-world control system exploitation has remained in the 
 hands of a few. To help the community mastering new skills we have develop
 ed „Damn Vulnerable Chemical Process“ – first open source framework 
 for cyber-physical experimentation based on two realistic models of chemic
 al plants.  Come to the session and take your first master class on comple
 x physical hacking.\n   \n   Marina is Senior Security Consultant at Europ
 ean Network for Cyber Security. Through her life she has accumulated vast 
 hands-on experience in several engineering fields. Most recently she compl
 eted her doctoral degree in ICS security at Hamburg University of Technolo
 gy\, Germany. Her research over the last few years has been focused on the

  Updates to the Wassenaar Arrangement in 2013 established among its 41 mem
 ber nations an agreement to place a variety of previously undesignated “
 cybersecurity items” under export control. After 18 months and a half-do
 zen open advisory meetings\, the U.S. has taken the entire security resear
 ch community by surprise with its proposed rule\; we are confronted by a s
 weeping implementation with profound consequences for academia\, independe
 nt research\, commercial cybersecurity\, human rights\, and national secur
 ity.\n \n While the outcome of this round of regulatory intervention is st
 ill uncertain\, the fact that there will be more is not. This panel of exp
 erts will discuss the context\, history\, and general process of regulatio
 n\, as well the related question of “weaponized” research in regulator
 y discourse.  \n \n There is significant daylight between the relatively l
 ax text of the Wassenaar Arrangement itself and the extraordinarily broad 
 implementation proposed in the U.S. What will the practical effects of tho
 se differences be\, and why did the U.S. diverge from the Wassenaar text? 
 Regulators are\, even now\, still struggling to comprehend what the conseq
 uences of this new “cyber rule” might be. So\, how are we to understan
 d this regulatory process? What are its objectives? Its impacts? Its limit
 s? How can we influence its outcomes?\n \n Eleventh-hour interventions are
  quickly becoming a hallmark of regulatory activities with implications fo
 r the wider world of information security\; the fight here is almost exclu
 sively a rearguard action. Without resorting to the usual polemics\, what 
 failures of analysis and advice are contributing to these missteps – on 
 both sides? What interests might encourage them? How are security research
 ers being caught so off-balance? Come victory or despair in the present ca
 se\, this panel aims to answer the question of whether there is a solution
  that prevents technology transfer to hostile nations while still enabling
  free markets\, freedom of expression\, and freedom of research.\n \n \n D

 al new research and real attacks in the area of wirelessly controlled gate
 s\, garages\, and cars. Many cars are now controlled from mobile devices o
 ver GSM\, while even more can be unlocked and ignitions started from wirel
 ess keyfobs over RF. All of these are subject to attack with low-cost tool
 s (such as RTL-SDR\, GNU Radio\, HackRF\, Arduino\, and even a Mattel toy)
 .\n   \n   We will investigate how these features work\, and of course\, h
 ow they can be exploited. I will be releasing new tools and vulnerabilitie
 s in this area\, such as key-space reduction attacks on fixed-codes\, adva
 nced "code grabbers" using RF attacks on encrypted and rolling codes\, and
  how to protect yourself against such issues.\n   \n   By the end of this 
 talk you’ll understand not only how vehicles and the wirelessly-controll
 ed physical access protecting them can be exploited\, but also learn about
  various tools for car and RF research\, as well as how to use and build y
 our own inexpensive devices for such investigation.\n   \n   Ladies and ge

  you ever wanted to kill someone? Do you want to get rid of your partner\,
  your boss or your arch nemesis? Perhaps you want to enjoy your life insur
 ance payout whilst you’re still alive. Do you have rich elderly parents 
 that just won’t die quick enough? Or do you want a “Do Over” new ide
 ntity.\n  \n Then\, this presentation is for you! I’ll provide you with 
 the insight and techniques on how to “kill” someone and obtain a real 
 death certificate and shutdown their lives. It focuses on the lack of secu
 rity controls that allow any of us to virtually kill off anyone or any num
 ber of people. Forget the Dexter way of killing someone\, I’ll show you 
 how to avoid the messy clean up and focusing in on the digital aspects. Yo
 u could be dead right now and not even know it.\n  \n The presentation wil
 l explain the death process and will highlight the vulnerabilities and its
  implications world-wide.\n \n You will learn:\n \n How to fill in a docto
 r’s medical cause of death certificate anonymously.\n How to become a fu
 neral director and dispose of the body.\n How to obtain a Death Certificat
 e.\n \n \n Once you’ve wrapped your mind around that concept\, I will al
 so show you how to “birth” Virtual identities that obtain real birth c
 ertificates. You will learn the birth registration process and the securit
 y vulnerabilities associated with this as well.\n \n The third and final s
 tep of the presentation is “The baby harvest”\, a concept that I’ve 
 developed\, which involves creating and raising virtual identities.  This 
 technique is similar to a shelf company. Virtuals will be “born”\, reg
 istered with the government complete with birth certificates and social se
 curity numbers. They can open up bank accounts\, get a virtual job to laun
 der money\, pay taxes\, obtain home loans and obtain life insurance polici
 es. They can be married to anyone (virtual or not) and be directors of com
 panies…. the list is endless and to complete the circle of life\, they c
 an be killed off when they are ready for “harvest” for their life insu
 rance payouts or sold as permanent I.D.’s. With no victim\, this is taki
 ng identity theft to the next level.\n \n Chris Rock has been active in th

  this battle between attack and defense\, I will demonstrate new defense s

 strategies without imposing significant runtime CPU overhead.\n \n Daniel

DESCRIPTION:\n When the Secretary of State says: “Please Stop Hacking Us
 …”\n David An Former U.S. State Department\n \n \n Senior American off
 icials routinely hold dialogues with foreign officials to discuss cyber es
 pionage. However\, if a cyber attack can be performed through proxy server
 s jumping several countries before reaching the U.S.\, then can anyone eve
 r be sure of who is really behind the attack? Yet we often see newspaper h
 eadlines clearly identifying that one country is hacking another country t
 hrough state-sponsored\, cyber criminal\, or hacktivist means.  Even if go
 vernment cyber analysts with TS/SCI security clearances have high confiden
 ce in the identity of an attacker based on forensics and human intelligenc
 e\, what are the challenges in effectively addressing the topic in a diplo
 matic or military dialogue with the attacker country?\n  \n Two major road
 blocks in cyber diplomacy are the "attribution problem\," and the related 
 "disclosure dilemma."  If there is indeed an attribution problem--when a c
 ountry cannot be sure which other state is hacking it because a third coun
 try could be using it as a proxy--then a country could never accuse anothe
 r countries of state-sponsored cyber attacks.  Yet\, countries routinely a
 ccuse others of cyber attacks\, the public sees this in newspapers almost 
 every day\, and it is often an important topic in bilateral dialogues. Fur
 thermore\, the disclosure dilemma occurs when a country has both incentive
 s and disincentives to disclose details on how it was hacked.  On one hand
 \, evidence will prove its case\, but on another hand\, evidence will make
  the attacker more savvy and careful not to repeat the same mistakes next 
 time.  Disclosure could create a stronger adversary.  These are major conc
 erns in the practice of cyber diplomacy today. \n  \n My presentation iden

DESCRIPTION:\n NetRipper - Smart traffic sniffing for penetration testers\
 n Ionut Popescu Senior Security Consultant at KPMG Romania\n \n The post-e
 xploitation activities in a penetration test can be challenging if the tes
 ter has low-privileges on a fully patched\, well configured Windows machin
 e. This work presents a technique for helping the tester to find useful in
 formation by sniffing network traffic of the applications on the compromis
 ed machine\, despite his low-privileged rights. Furthermore\, the encrypte
 d traffic is also captured before being sent to the encryption layer\, thu
 s all traffic (clear-text and encrypted) can be sniffed. The implementatio
 n of this technique is a tool called NetRipper which uses API hooking to d
 o the actions mentioned above and which has been especially designed to be
  used in penetration tests\, but the concept can also be used to monitor n
 etwork traffic of employees or to analyze a malicious application.\n \n Io

DESCRIPTION:\n \n Hooked Browser Meshed-Networks with WebRTC and BeEF\n Ch
 ristian (@xntrik) Frichot Principal Security Consultant at Asterisk Inform
 ation Security\n \n One of the biggest issues with BeEF is that each hooke
 d browser has to talk to your BeEF server. To try and avoid detection\, yo
 u often want to try and obfuscate or hide your browsers\, particularly if 
 you're heavily targeting a single organization. Don’t worry Internet-fri
 ends\, those crazy pioneers at Google\, Mozilla and Opera have solved this
  problem for you with the introduction of Web Real-Time Communications (We
 bRTC). Initially designed to allow browsers to stream multimedia to each o
 ther\, the spec has made its way into most Chrome and Firefox browsers\, n
 ot to mention it’s enabled by default.\n \n Using this bleeding-edge web
  technology\, we can now mesh all those hooked browsers\, funnelling all y
 our BeEF comms through a single sacrificial beach-head. Leveraging WebRTC 
 technologies (such as STUN/TURN and even the fact the RTC-enabled browsers
  on local subnets can simply UDP each other)\, meshing browsers together c
 an really throw a spanner into an incident-responders work. The possibilit
 ies for a browser-attacker are fairly endless\, channeling comms through a
  single browser\, or\, making all the browsers communicate with each other
  in round-robin. This is just another tool tucked into your belt to try an
 d initiate and maintain control over browsers.\n \n This presentation will
  present a background into WebRTC\, and then demonstrate the WebRTC BeEF e
 xtension. (Bloody JavaScript...)\n \n Christian is an Australian security 
 professional and founder of Asterisk Information Security based in Perth. 
 He is one of the co-authors of the recently published Browser Hacker’s H
 andbook (by Wiley)\, and long-term code-funkerer of the BeEF project. When

 ch can solve relatively hard problems\, and that claim has been met with m

  malicious executables into an optimization problem which a D-Wave machine
  can solve. Specifically\, using a 512-qubit D-Wave Two processor\, we sho

DESCRIPTION:\n \n Advances in Linux Process Forensics Using ECFS\n Ryan O'
 Neill Security Consultant\, Leviathan Security Group\n \n Many hackers tod
 ay are using process memory infections to maintain stealth residence insid
 e of a compromised system. The current state of forensics tools in Linux\,
  lack the sophistication used by the infection methods found in real world
  hacks. ECFS (Extended core file snapshot) technology\, https://github.com
 /elfmaster/ecfs is an innovative extension to regular ELF core files\, des
 igned to be used as forensics-friendly snapshots of process memory. A brie
 f showcasing of the ECFS technology was featured in POC||GTFO 0x7 (Innovat
 ions with core files).\n \n However this talk will reveal deeper insight o
 n the many features of this technology\, such as full symbol table reconst
 ruction\, builtin detection heuristics\, and how common binutils such as o
 bjdump\, and readelf can be used to quickly identify complex infections su
 ch as PLT/GOT hooks and shared library injection. We will also cover the l
 ibecfs API that was created specifically for malware and forensics analyst
 s who aim to implement support for ECFS snapshots into new or existing mal
 ware detection software. \n \n While the ECFS core format was initially de
 signed for runtime malware and forensics purposes\, another very neat aspe
 ct to this technology was quickly extrapolated on\; the ECFS snapshots can
  also be reloaded into memory and executed. Very similar to VM snapshots\,
  which opens many more doors for research and exploration in a vast array 
 of areas from dynamic analysis to migrating live processes across systems.
  ECFS is still a work in progress\, but for those who understand the arduo
 us nature of dissecting a process and identifying anomalies\, will surely 
 acquire a quick respect for the new technology that makes all of this so m
 uch easier.\n \n \n Ryan 'elfmaster' O'Neill is a computer security resear
 cher at Leviathan Security and the maintainer of Bitlackeys.org\, a hub fo

  popping something and not having full administrative level rights over th

  pillaging systems can be difficult and require extensive time if successf
 ul at all. One of the most challenging aspects around pentesting was the n
 eed to have administrative level rights\, install your tools\, and from th
 ere leverage the compromised machine as a pivot point for lateral movement
  in the network. Well\, the time has changed. Introducing Pivoter – a re
 verse connection transparent proxy that supports the ability to pivot with
  ease. Pivoter is a full transparent proxy that supports the ability to us
 e limited rights on a system to pivot to other systems and attack transpar
 ently from your system at home. Port scans\, exploits\, brute forcing\, an
 ything you could do like you were on that network is now available through
  Pivoter. As part of this talk\, we’ll be releasing a new Metasploit mod

 a Windows version of Pivoter\, and a PowerShell version of Pivoter. msf> r

  technical capabilities of Regin and its counterparts \n Omer Coskun Ethic
 al Hacker with KPN REDteam\, KPN (Royal Dutch Telecom)\n \n The recent res

 uch like  Flame\, Duqu\, Uruborus and the Regin revealed that these were d
 esigned to sustain  long-term intelligence-gathering operations by remaini
 ng under the radar. Antivirus companies made a great job in revealing  tec
 hnical details of the attack campaigns\, however\, it exclusively has almo
 st focused on the executables or the memory dump of the infected systems -
  the research hasn't been simulated in a real environment.\n  \n GSM netwo
 rks still use ancient protocols\; Signaling System 7 (SS7)\, GPRS Tunnelin
 g Protocol (GTP) and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) which
  contain loads of vulnerable components. Malware authors totally aware of 
 it and  weaponing exploits within their campaigns to grab encrypted and un
 encrypted  streams of private communications handled by the Telecom compan
 ies. For instance\, Regin was developed as a framework that can be customi
 zed with a wide range of different capabilities\,  one of the most interes
 ting ability to monitor GSM networks.\n  \n In this talk\, we are going to
  break down the Regin framework stages from a reverse engineering perspect

 ion scheme\, kernel mode manager- while analyzing its behaviors on a GSM n
 etwork and making technical comparison of its counterparts - such as TDL4\

 chine (VM) are real and practical thanks to the architecture that has many
  imperfections in the way shared resources are isolated.\n \n This talk wi
 ll demonstrate how a non-privileged application from one VM can ex-filtrat
 e data or even establish a reverse shell into a co-located VM using a cach
 e timing covert channel that is totally hidden from the standard access co
 ntrol mechanisms while being able to offer surprisingly high bps at a low 
 error rate.\n \n In this talk you'll learn about the various concepts\, te
 chniques and challenges involve in the design of a cache timing covert cha
 nnel on x86 multi-core such as:\n \n \n An overview of some of the X86 sha
 red resources and how we can use / abuse them to carry information across 
 VMs.\n Fundamental concept behind cache line encoding / decoding.\n Gettin
 g around the hardware pre-fetching logic ( without disabling it from the B
 IOS! )\n Data persistency and noise. What can be done?\n Guest to host pag
 e table de-obfuscation. The easy way.\n Phase Lock Loop and high precision
  inter-VM synchronization. All about timers.\n \n \n At the end of this ta
 lk we will go over a working VM to VM reverse shell example as well as som
 e surprising bandwidth measurement results. We will also cover the detecti
 on aspect and the potential countermeasure to defeat such a communication 
 channel. The source code is going to be release at that time on 'github'\n

DESCRIPTION:\n Hackers Hiring Hackers - How to Do Things Better\n Tottenko
 ph Security Consultant\, Rapid7\n IrishMASMS Hacker\n \n There are a lot o
 f talks about how to be a better pen tester and workshops that show you ho
 w to use all of the cool new tools that are available to make our jobs eas
 ier\, but there are only a few talks that address what some of us consider
  to be the hardest part of getting a job in security: the hiring process. 
 The information security field is in desperate need of people with the tec
 hnical skills hackers have to fill a myriad of roles within organizations 
 across the world. However\, both sides of the table are doing horribly whe
 n it comes to hiring and interviewing for work.\n \n Organizations are doi
 ng poorly trying to communicate expectations for a job\, there are people 
 going to interviews without knowing how to showcase their (limited or vast
 ) experience\, and some people posture themselves so poorly that the hirin
 g managers don’t think the candidates are really interested in the job. 
 This talk takes the experiences of the speakers as both interviewers and i
 nterviewees as well as from others within the scene in order to help bette
 r prepare hackers to enter (or move within) “the industry” as well as 
 let the people making hiring decisions know what they can do to get the pe
 ople and experience they need for their teams.\n \n Tottenkoph has been ha
 cking for the past 10 years and is currently a security consultant for Rap
 id7. Tottie has spoken at several hacker cons and is currently pursuing he
 r Master’s degree in Industrial and Organizational Psychology\, planning
  to apply its practices to the hacker and infosec communities.\n \n Twitte
 r: @Tottenkoph\n \n IrishMASMS is an old school hacker\, fighting the good
  fight in Computer Network Defence (CND)/blue team efforts for over 16 yea
 rs. Been lurking about since DEF CON 10\, DJing the B&W ball at DEF CON 18
  (with quite a few AP pool shindigs and private parties along the way). Pa
 nel member at HOPE 5\, presenter at a couple of Notacon’s\, and some oth
 er conferences that are hard to remember what really happened. Having prog
 ressed through the ranks to hiring manager and director level\, he has exp
 erienced the pain from both sides of the hiring process and desires to imp
 rove the situation for the InfoSec community. Is this where we mention cyb

  our goal to help you get the best experience possible.  In addition to i
 ntroducing each of the different aspects and areas of DEF CON\, we have a 
 panel of speakers that will talk about how they came to be part of DEF CON
  and their personal experiences over the years.\n \n Mike Petruzzi has bee

  form of social life. I hate you all\, seriously..\n \n Twitter: @X72\n \n
  Plug is a Mexican immigrant that immigrated to the States at age 18. Whil
 e learning to read English found a 2600 magazine that lead him to his firs

 security enthusiast.  Over the years he has worked a System's Administrat
 or with a focus in security\, eventually moving full time to work in infor
 mation security.  Plug currently works as a Senior Security Engineer secu
 ring the network of a prominent finance and foreign exchange company.  He
  is also working on a volunteer project to teach 5th graders basic compute
 r security skills. In his free time he enjoys playing with synthesizers an
 d modular systems\, when possible he volunteers his time to computer secur

 over 25 years experience in hacking. Russ first learned to program around 
 the 1982 timeframe\, when he received a Timex Sinclair\, which used only p
 rograms keyed in via BASIC. He’s been involved in a numbers of aspects o

 s a pervasive part of everyone’s everyday life. Whether it be home netwo
 rks\, open hotspots at cafés\, corporate networks or corporate guest netw

 hich is common in the case of guest networks. But is this enough? And what
  new threats could be unleashed from even the most isolated of Wi-Fi netwo
 rks?\n \n In the most paranoid of cases\, companies will generally attempt
  to isolate Wi-Fi networks from their official networks in order to protec
 t their own assets from attacks\, while still ensuring that Wi-Fi is conve
 nient for end users. But there is another way to attack a company that cou
 ld be damaging to the host company and harmful to other targets. This pres
 entation will go over the utilization of various techniques of getting ont
 o and getting out through publicly accessible Wi-Fi networks for nefarious
  purposes\,  termed Wi-Fi Exfiltration. Through this technique one is able
  to obfuscate their identity by using the host of the Wi-Fi’s identity\,
  thus implicating the host in the attack.\n \n During the presentation we 
 will cover the findings through our tests along with a list of recommendat

SUMMARY:Dark side of the ELF — leveraging dynamic loading to pwn noobs

DESCRIPTION:\n Dark side of the ELF - leveraging dynamic loading to pwn no
 obs\n Alessandro Di Federico PhD Student\, Politecnico di Milano\n Yan Sho
 shitaishvili PhD Student\, UC Santa Barbara\n \n \n The ELF format is anci
 ent\, and much mystery lurks in its dark depths. For 16 years\, it has saf
 ely encompassed our software\, providing support for binary loading\, symb
 ol resolution\, and lots of very useful binary stuff. In that time\, secur
 ity has become a key concern\, resulting in binary defenses like NX and AS
 LR\, which have made exploiting vulnerabilities quite difficult. ASLR\, fo
 r example\, randomizes the location of the stack\, the heap\, libraries\, 
 and (optionally)\, the binary itself at every execution of an application.
 \n \n There is no easy way to say this: ELF has let us down. In this talk\
 , we'll explore the dark side of ELF. Specifically\, we'll show how ELF\, 
 by design\, implicitly trusts data structures in the ELF headers. Even in 
 the presence of ASLR\, an attacker able to corrupt these headers can trick
  the ELF loader into calling any function in any linked-in library\, provi
 ding nothing but the name of the binary. In essence\, this technique allow
 s an attacker to call arbitrary library functions (such as system()!) with
 out leaking memory addresses. We call this technique Leakless.\n \n While 
 developing Leakless\, we checked many different implementations of the sta
 ndard C library and found that Leakless can be adapted to attack the ELF l
 oader implementations in all of the common ones (i.e.\, GNU libc\, the lib
 c of the major BSDs\, and uClibc). In this talk\, we'll describe the inter
 nals of the ELF format\, show how Leakless works to subvert library functi
 on resolution\, and demonstrate how it can be use to carry out attacks wit
 hout information disclosures. And\, of course\, we'll open-source the tool
  that we developed to make carrying out this attack easier.\n \n Alessandr
 o is a PhD student at Politecnico Di Milano\, right under that leaning tow
 er. In his spare time\, he hacks with Tower of Hanoi. He likes exploitatio
 n and doing really crazy stuff\, on and off the computer!\n \n Hacking sin
 ce the age of eight\, Yan Shoshitaishvili is fascinated by understanding a
 nd commandeering the computation and actions carried out by binary code. H
 e is currently pursuing his PhD in the Seclab at UC Santa Barbara and is o
 ne of the hacking aces behind team Shellphish. In the little spare time he
  has left\, he develops and releases computer security tools on the Intern

DESCRIPTION:\n Sorry\, Wrong Number: Mysteries Of The Phone System - Past 
 and Present\n "Unregistered436" Patrick McNeil Security Architect\n "Snide
 " Owen Security Researcher\n \n \n Exploring the phone system was once the
  new and exciting realm of “phone phreaks\,” an ancestor of today’s 
 computer “hackers.” The first phreaks “owned” and explored the vag
 ue mysteries of the telephone network for a time until their activities dr
 ew too much attention from the phone companies and law enforcement. The ph
 one system evolved\, somewhat\, in an attempt to shut them out\, and phrea
 king became both difficult and legally dangerous. Such events paralleled a
  new personal computer “revolution” wherein phone phreaks made the tra
 nsition from the secret subtleties of telephony to the new and mystical fr
 ontier of personal computing. Private BBS(s) and\, eventually\, the Intern
 et was not only the next logical step forward\, but also provided “safer
 ” alternatives that still allowed for the thrill of exploring the myster
 ies of a new modern age. Telephony\, and voice security in general\, becam
 e\, as the years passed\, something of a lost art to all but those who rem
 ember...\n  \n In this presentation we begin our adventure with a journey 
 back in time\, starting in the post-war Film Noir era of the 40’s and 50
 ’s\, when users required an operator at the switchboard to make a call\,
  investigating some of the early roots of phreaking that many have forgott
 en. We will briefly take a look at the weaknesses of early telephone syste
 ms and the emergence of the original phreaks in the 50’s and 60’s who 
 found and exploited them. Our journey will also allow us to demonstrate ho
 w some of the same basic phreaking approaches are still applicable to toda
 y’s "advanced" VoIP systems.\n  \n Certainly the initial creation and em
 ergence of VoIP opened a variety of attack vectors that were covered at se
 curity conferences at the time. Commercial VoIP adoption\, however\, remai
 ned stagnant until standards and carriers caught up. Some VoIP hacking too
 ls were left unmaintained\, and VoIP wasn’t the sexy and mysterious atta
 ck vector it once was with the exception of tricksters who found old or in
 secure systems to be easy targets. Due to increased VoIP adoption over the
  last few years\, however\, telephony attacks are provocative once again.\
 n  \n As hardboiled VoIP detectives\, we’ll unravel the mysteries of the
  curious\, shadowy\, and secretive world of phreaks\, tricksters\, and VoI
 P hackers. We’ll compare and contrast old school phreaking with new adva
 nces in VoIP hacking. We’ll explain how voice systems are targeted\, how
  they are attacked using old and new methods\, and how to secure them - wi
 th demonstrations along with practical and actionable tips along the way. 
 We may even drop a new VoIP telephony phishing tool to fuse the past and t
 he present..\n  \n \n Patrick spoke about telephony fraud last year at DEF
  CON Skytalks (“How To Make Money Fast Using A Pwned PBX”)\, and is a 
 #telephreak at heart. He has over twenty years of experience\, mostly with
  telecom manufacturers\, and spent time in charge of product security for 
 the communications security business of a fortune 100 company. When not wo

  fields including Server Administration\, DevOps\, Application Security an
 d most recently as a penetration tester. He enjoys tinkering with various 
 technologies\, and has experimented for prolonged periods with PBXs and th

DESCRIPTION:\n Secure Messaging for Normal People\n Justin Engler Senior S
 ecurity Engineer\, iSEC Partners\n \n "Secure" messaging programs and prot
 ocols continue to proliferate\, and crypto experts can debate their minuti
 ae\, but there is very little information available to help the rest of th
 e world differentiate between the different programs and their features. T
 his talk will discuss the types of attacks various secure messaging featur
 es can defend against so those who are tech-savvy but not crypto-experts c
 an make informed decisions on which crypto applications to use. \n \n This
  talk is intended for people with no preexisting cryptography knowledge. T
 here will be no math or programming knowledge required. The goal is to exp
 lain secure messaging concepts such as PKI\, PFS\, and key validation with
 out diving into heavier crypto\, math\, or programming content.\n \n Justi
 n Engler is a Principal Security Engineer with NCC Group. Justin has been 
 involved in application security assessments of many open and closed sourc
 e messaging applications and other related technologies. He has spoken pre
 viously at DEF CON\, BlackHat\, Toorcon\, and other regional events. Justi
 n has 5 years of security consulting experience and has been involved in s
 ecurity\, software development\, and IT professionally for over 10 years.
